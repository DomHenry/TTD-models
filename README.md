The material provided here is the supplementary material for *Henry et al. 2019. Can time-to-detection models with fewer survey replicates provide a robust alternative to traditional site-occupancy models? Methods in Ecology and Evolution* 

The R code and JAGS model definitions are provided to reproduce the simulations and graphical outputs. We also define the models used to analyses the field data.
